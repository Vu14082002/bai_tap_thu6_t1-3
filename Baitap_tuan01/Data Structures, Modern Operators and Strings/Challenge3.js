// Coding Challenge #3
// Let's continue with our football betting app! This time, we have a map called
// 'gameEvents' (see below) with a log of the events that happened during the
// game. The values are the events themselves, and the keys are the minutes in which
// each event happened (a football game has 90 minutes plus some extra time).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Create an array 'events' of the different game events that happened (no duplicates)
// 2. After the game has finished, is was found that the yellow card from minute 64 was unfair. So remove this event from the game events log.
// 3. Compute and log the following string to the console: "An event happened, on average, every 9 minutes" (keep in mind that a game has 90 minutes)
// 4. Loop over 'gameEvents' and log each element to the console, marking whether it's in the first half or second half (after 45 min) of the game, like this:
// [FIRST HALF] 17: ⚽ GOAL
const gameEvents = new Map([
  [17, "GOAL"],
  [36, "Substitution"],
  [47, "GOAL"],
  [61, "Substitution"],
  [64, "Yellow card"],
  [69, "Red card"],
  [70, "Substitution"],
  [72, "Substitution"],
  [76, "GOAL"],
  [80, "GOAL"],
  [92, "Red card"],
]);
const events = [...new Set(gameEvents.values())];
console.log(events);
// 2
gameEvents.delete(64);
// 3
const num = gameEvents.size;
const avg = 90 / num;
console.log(`An event happened, on average, every ${avg} minutes`);
// 4
for (const [minute, evant] of gameEvents) {
  const time = minute < 45 ? "FIRST HAFT" : "SECOND HAFT";
  console.log(`[${time}] ${minute} : ${evant}`);
}
